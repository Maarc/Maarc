### Hi there 👋

I'm [Marc](https://www.zottner.com/), an Application [Archeologist](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/legacy-infrastructure-saqqara-necropolis-world-marc-zottner/) and Executive Advisor at [VMware Tanzu](https://tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu).

### What I do 👨🏻‍💻 

Former field CTO, transformation program lead, consulting architect, middleware specialist, and trainer, I have an extensive experience in the application ecosystem. Transformation, security, platform, open-source, and architecture are my favorite topics. Recently I co-authored my first eBook: [The Legacy Trap](https://via.vmware.com/legacy-trap/).
